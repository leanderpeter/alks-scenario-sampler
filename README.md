# alks-scenario-sampler
To assure the quality of an algorithm testing of the algorithm against predefined requirements and validation if the behavior is as expected is necessary. In our case we are testing 15 scenarios given from the ASAM E.V. with a focus on “Automated Lane Keeping Systems.” ASAM E.V. and BMW undertook the task of using OpenSCENARIO and OpenDRIVE standard to implement the ALKS regulatory test program, resulting in an executable XML file package with a standard-compatible simulator. The package can be found on GitHub and is licensed under the create commons CC BY-SA 4.0 and thereby free to use, modify and build on the material for any purpose, even commercial. In detail the xml files describe specific traffic scenarios with various parameter settings like vehicle position, lateral velocity, distance etc. The goal is to vary the variable parameters in a way we gain as much information out of the least amount of experiments.
